# Part of the foodpanda lessons related to DSA stuff

Publishing this to github for visibility sake since I am just starting my career, gotta look decent at least. I have other notes relating to DSA beyond what is shown here and practise ✨Leetcode✨ sometimes.

## Linked-Lists

### Activity #1: Create a simple main program that uses a linked list structure

1. Create an instance of the linked list.
2. Add 4 items to it by calling the `addNode()` function.
3. Now call the `printAllNodes` function to verify that the items were added correctly to the linked list.

### Activity #2: Adding more functions to the linked list structure

1. `remove()` that removes an item at a specified position.
2. `addAtPos()` that adds an item at a specified position.
3. `get()` that retrieves the item at a specified position.
4. Now write code in your main program to test the above 3 functions.

## Stacks

### Activity #1: Create a simple main program that uses a stack structure

1. Create an instance of the stack.
2. Push 4 items it by calling the push() function.
3. Now call the printAllNodes() function to verify the nodes were pushed correctly into the
stack. (The items should be printed in the reverse manner that they go into the stack.)

### Activity #2: Printing contents of the stack in main program

Sometimes, there is no function in the stack structure that allows printing of all its nodes. Now you
would write code in the main program that will allow you to print the contents in a stack. (hint you
may need another instance of certain data structure)

### Activity #3: Checking for unbalanced parenthesis in a program

Stacks can be used to check for unbalanced parenthesis in a program. Write a program that checks a
user input of a program and displays if the program contains unbalanced parenthesis.
