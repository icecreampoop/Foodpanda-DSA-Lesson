## Linked-Lists

### Activity #1: Create a simple main program that uses a linked list structure

1. Create an instance of the linked list.
2. Add 4 items to it by calling the `addNode()` function.
3. Now call the `printAllNodes` function to verify that the items were added correctly to the linked list.

### Activity #2: Adding more functions to the linked list structure

1. `remove()` that removes an item at a specified position.
2. `addAtPos()` that adds an item at a specified position.
3. `get()` that retrieves the item at a specified position.
4. Now write code in your main program to test the above 3 functions.
